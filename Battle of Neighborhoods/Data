The data:

To carry out this Project and help Roberto in his new Project, we are going to need:

· Data about the districts of Bogota, it will be extracted from Wikipedia. 
· Geolocation data of these districts, provided by Open Street Map APIs. 
· The Foursquare data about the different venues of the Districts: Burger Restaurants, Universities and High Schools and Offices venues.


With all this data I consider that I will be able to determine which is the best district to open the new Roberto Burger restaurant.
